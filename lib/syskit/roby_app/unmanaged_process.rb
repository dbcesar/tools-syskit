        # availability of the expected remote tasks. The thread returns when the
        # tasks are resolved properly.
        #
        # {#monitor_thread} is started by {#wait_running} when {#spawn_thread}
        # has returned. It verifies that the tasks resolvd by {#spawn_thread}
        # are still present. The thread returns when it is not the case.
        #
        # Finally {#kill_thread} is started by {#kill}. It terminates the two
        # other threads.
        #
        # Whether the process is stil in a good state or not should be tested
        # with {#dead?}. {#verify_threads_state} verifies that the threads
        # themselves did not terminate with an exception (and throw the
