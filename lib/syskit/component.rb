        # Base class for models that represent components (TaskContext,
        # Composition)
        #
        # The model-level methods (a.k.a. singleton methods) are defined on
        # Models::Component). See the documentation of Model for an explanation of
        # this.
        #
        # Components may be data service providers. Two types of data sources
        # exist:
        # * main services are root data services that can be provided
        #   independently
        # * slave sources are data services that depend on another service. For
        #   instance, an ImageProvider source of a StereoCamera task could be
        #   slave of the main PointCloudProvider source.
        #
        # Data services are referred to by name. In the case of a main service,
        # its name is the name used during the declaration. In the case of slave
        # services, it is main_data_service_name.slave_name. I.e. the name of
        # the slave service depends on the selected
